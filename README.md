multihash
=========

This is a simple and short interactive script for Linux systems to get multiple
file hashes (hence the project name ‘multihash’) of a file, using the `md5sum`,
`sha1sum`, `sha256sum`, `sha384sum`, `sha512sum` commands which should be
pre-installed on most modern Linux systems.

#### Usage

Type in the file location and the script should give you the correct
output. Should you be done, enter `!exit` and the script stops.
